Like a blog, but with a list of songs I like

Website : https://gouz.github.io/muzik/

To build you own, change the `src/static/list.json` file and run 

```sh
npm run build
```

## @TODO

- [ ] SHA1 for urls, then the list can be shuffled with no consequences
- [X] SoundCloud integration
- [ ] Background color according to the media
- [X] Preview should be adjusted to the size of the media
- [ ] Sharing og:datas
